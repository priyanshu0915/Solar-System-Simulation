# Planet Simulation using Pygame

This project simulates a simplified model of the solar system using Python and Pygame. It visualizes the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies and models their orbits around the sun. Each planetâ€™s motion is influenced by Newton's law of universal gravitation, and their positions and velocities are updated accordingly, creating a dynamic representation of the solar system.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Gravitational Simulation**: Each planet's movement is calculated based on the gravitational forces exerted by other planets, following Newtonian mechanics.
- **Scaled Representation**: Distances and velocities are scaled to fit within the screen dimensions, offering an accurate depiction of relative distances.
- **Planetary Orbits**: Each planet leaves an orbit trail, visualizing its path around the sun, adding to the realism of the simulation.
- **Planet Labels and Distances**: Displays each planet's name and its distance from the sun in kilometers for added clarity.

## How it Works
- Each planet is initialized with a mass, radius, color, and initial velocity. 
- The gravitational force is calculated based on the distance between each planet and the sun or other planets, influencing its trajectory.
- The Pygame library is used to render the planets, their orbits, and labels in real-time, creating an interactive and visually appealing simulation.

This project serves as a fun and educational tool to visualize planetary motion and can be further extended to include more celestial objects, interstellar effects, or even interactive features!
